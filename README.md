# gamefaqs-reader

A simple electron application that helps to find and read guides from the website gamefaqs.

This application is intended to be used on a steam deck, but will run in any linux envronment that supports AppImages. Adding in windows + mac builds is trivial is there is a desire for it running elsewhere (make a github issue).

This application is provided as-is. There is no guarantee that it will continue to work in the future. I currently use this application, so I will continue to support it and am happy to accept PRs!

## Features

- Search gamefaqs for game guides
- Multiple zoom levels
